## Inspiration
We were inspired by the recent dogecoin craze and how Elon Musk always praises it on social media and the popular web game Cookie Clicker.
## How we built it
We used Reactjs, Google Firestore, Node.js, Figma, and scss.
## What does it do
Dogelon Musk is a dogecoin clicker simulator. The player starts off with a base amount of money and is able to buy and sell dogecoin by clicking it to earn profit. The money you make will be used to buy rocket parts to send Elon Musk to the moon. However, if the user clicks too many times the price of dogecoin may drop and the player may lose all of their profit.
## Challenges we ran into
Some of the challenges we ran into were not knowing how to use Google Firestore and canvasjs, trying to deal with react states, working with the learning curve of react, and having a hard time acknowledging what was possible for us to accomplish in 24 hours.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some of the accomplishments we were proud of was our git management and UI, being able to source control, understand Google Firestore, and being organized.
## What we learned
We learned about state hooks, arrow functions, Google Firestore, and our strengths and weaknesses.
## What's next for Elon Simulator 
If given more time, we would like to expand on aspects of the game such as adding more levels (sending Elon to more planets) and create a stock graph.
